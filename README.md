# JsonValidatorProcessor
Nifi processor that takes in Json Schema and validates flowfiles accordingly

This uses the ever-it json validator, as that apparently the fastest validator available.

Shout out to http://www.nifi.rocks/ for their article on creating processors.

The latest version of nifi, 1.4.0 has validator for JSON.

This was created a month before the version went live.
